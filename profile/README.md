The Umbraco Community GitHub organisation is a home for community packages that are maintained by groups of people, or individuals who no longer want sole-maintainer (or any) responsibility.

The organisation is managed by people from both Umbraco HQ and the commmunity. Each package has it's own list of maintainers and contributors. 

If you would like to transfer your package to this organisation, or have questions about the maintenance of any of these projects, please contact the Umbraco Developer Relations team at https://umbra.co/contact-devrel
